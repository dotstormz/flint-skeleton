# Flint Project Skeleton
This repository holds the skeleton for a full project based on [Flint](https://bitbucket.org/StudioNoneDev/flint), an extension to Silex that adds functionality and gives some declarative and conventional structure to an otherwise amazing library.

## Usage
Starting a new Flint project is as simple as running this command (replacing parts where appropriate):
```
composer create-project studionone/flint-skeleton <target-folder> --repository-url=https://bitbucket.org/StudioNoneDev/flint-skeleton.git
```

## Licence
Flint and Flint Skeleton are owned by Studio None, and released under an MIT license
