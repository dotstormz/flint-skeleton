# Flint Project Skeleton
This repository holds the skeleton for a full project based on [Flint](https://github.com/studionone/Flint), an extension to Silex that adds functionality and gives some declarative and conventional structure to an otherwise amazing library.

## Usage
Until we get Statis up and running for our own private Composer repository, you'll have to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:studionone/flint-skeleton.git <target-folder>`
2. Install the dependencies: `cd <target-folder> && composer install`
3. Verify the installation is working: `php -S localhost:8080 ./web/index.php`
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and you should see Flint working
